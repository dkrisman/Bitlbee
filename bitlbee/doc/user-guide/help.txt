?quickstart
Welcome to BitlBee, your IRC gateway to ICQ, MSN, AOL, Jabber, Yahoo! and Twitter.

The center of BitlBee is the control channel, &bitlbee. Two users will always be there, you (where "you" is the nickname you are using) and the system user, root.

You need register so that all your IM settings (passwords, contacts, etc) can be saved on the BitlBee server. It's important that you pick a good password so no one else can access your account. Register with this password using the register command: register <password> (without the brackets!).

Be sure to remember your password. The next time you connect to the BitlBee server you will need to identify <password> so that you will be recognised and logged in to all the IM services automatically.

When finished, type help quickstart2 to continue.
%
?quickstart2
Step Two: Add and Connect To your IM Account(s).

To add an account to the account list you will need to use the account add command: account add <protocol> <username> <password> [<server>].

For instance, suppose you have a Jabber account at jabber.org with handle bitlbee@jabber.org with password QuickStart, you would:

<you> account add jabber bitlbee@jabber.org QuickStart
<root> Account successfully added

Other available IM protocols are msn, oscar, yahoo and twitter. OSCAR is the protocol used by ICQ and AOL. For more information about the account add command, see help account add.

When you are finished adding your account(s) use the account on command to enable all your accounts, type help quickstart3 to continue.
%
?quickstart3
Step Three: Managing Contact Lists: Rename

Now BitlBee logs in and downloads the contact list from the IM server. In a few seconds, all your on-line buddies should show up in the control channel.

BitlBee will convert names into IRC-friendly form (for instance: tux@example.com will be given the nickname tux). If you have more than one person who would have the same name by this logic (for instance: tux@example.com and tux@bitlbee.org) the second one to log on will be tux_. The same is true if you have a tux log on to AOL and a tux log on from Yahoo.

It would be easy to get these two mixed up, so BitlBee has a rename command to change the nickname into something more suitable: rename <oldnick> <newnick>

<you> rename tux_ bitlbeetux
* tux_ is now known as bitlbeetux
<root> Nick successfully changed

When finished, type help quickstart4 to continue.
%
?quickstart4
Step Four: Managing Contact Lists: Add and Remove.

Now you might want to add some contacts, to do this we will use the add command. It needs two arguments: a connection ID (which can be a number (try account list), protocol name or (part of) the screenname) and the user's handle. It is used in the following way: add <connection> <handle>

<you> add 0 r2d2@example.com
* r2d2  has joined &bitlbee

In this case r2d2 is online, since he/she joins the channel immediately. If the user is not online you will not see them join until they log on.

Lets say you accidentally added r2d3@example.com rather than r2d2@example.com, or maybe you just want to remove a user from your list because you never talk to them. To remove a name you will want to use the remove command: remove <nick>

When finished, type help quickstart5 to continue.
%
?quickstart5
Step Five: Chatting.

First of all, a person must be on your contact list for you to chat with them (unless it's a group chat, help groupchats for more). If someone not on your contact list sends you a message, simply add them to the proper account with the add command. Once they are on your list and online, you can chat with them in &bitlbee:

<you> tux: hey, how's the weather down there?
<tux> you: a bit chilly!

Note that, although all contacts are in the &bitlbee channel, only tux will actually receive this message. The &bitlbee channel shouldn't be confused with a real IRC channel.

If you prefer chatting in a separate window, use the /msg or /query command, just like on real IRC. BitlBee will remember how you talk to someone and show his/her responses the same way. If you want to change the default behaviour (for people you haven't talked to yet), see help set private.

You know the basics. If you want to get to know more about BitlBee, please type help quickstart6.
%
?quickstart6
So you want more than just chatting? Or maybe you're just looking for a feature?

You can type help set to learn more about the possible BitlBee user settings. Among these user settings you will find options for common issues, such as changing the charset, HTML stripping and automatic connecting (simply type set to see current user settings).

For more subjects (like groupchats and away states), please type help index.

If you're still looking for something, please visit us in #bitlbee on the OFTC network (you can connect via irc.bitlbee.org), or mail us your problem/suggestion. Good luck and enjoy the Bee!

?account
Syntax: account [<account id>] <action> [<arguments>]

Available actions: add, del, list, on, off and set. See help account <action> for more information.
%
?account add
Syntax: account add <protocol> <username> [<password>]

Adds an account on the given server with the specified protocol, username and password to the account list. Supported protocols right now are: Jabber, MSN, OSCAR (AIM/ICQ), Yahoo and Twitter. For more information about adding an account, see help account add <protocol>.

You can omit the password and enter it separately using the IRC /OPER command. This lets you enter your password without your IRC client echoing it on screen or recording it in logs.
%
?account add jabber
Syntax: account add jabber <handle@server.tld> [<password>]

The handle should be a full handle, including the domain name. You can specify a servername if necessary. Normally BitlBee doesn't need this though, since it's able to find out the server by doing DNS SRV lookups.

In previous versions it was also possible to specify port numbers and/or SSL in the server tag. This is deprecated and should now be done using the account set command. This also applies to specifying a resource in the handle (like wilmer@bitlbee.org/work).
%
?account add msn
Syntax: account add msn <handle@server.tld> [<password>]

For MSN connections there are no special arguments.
%
?account add oscar
Syntax: account add oscar <handle> [<password>]

OSCAR is the protocol used to connect to AIM and/or ICQ. The servers will automatically detect if you're using a numeric or non-numeric username so there's no need to tell which network you want to connect to.

Example:
<wilmer> account add oscar 72696705 hobbelmeeuw
<root> Account successfully added
%
?account add twitter
Syntax: account add twitter <handle> [<password>]

This module gives you simple access to Twitter and Twitter API compatible services.

By default all your Twitter contacts will appear in a new channel called #twitter_yourusername. You can change this behaviour using the mode setting (see help set mode).

To send tweets yourself, send them to the twitter_(yourusername) contact, or just write in the groupchat channel if you enabled that option.

Since Twitter now requires OAuth authentication, you should not enter your Twitter password into BitlBee. Just type a bogus password. The first time you log in, BitlBee will start OAuth authentication. (See help set oauth.)

To use a non-Twitter service, change the base_url setting. For identi.ca, you can simply use account add identica.
%
?account add identica
Syntax: account add identica <handle> [<password>]

Same protocol as twitter, but defaults to a base_url pointing at identi.ca, and with OAuth disabled.
%
?account add yahoo
Syntax: account add yahoo <handle> [<password>]

For Yahoo! connections there are no special arguments.
%
?account del
Syntax: account <account id> del

This commands deletes an account from your account list. You should signoff the account before deleting it.

The account ID can be a number/tag (see account list), the protocol name or (part of) the screenname, as long as it matches only one connection.
%
?account on
Syntax: account [<account id>] on

This command will try to log into the specified account. If no account is specified, BitlBee will log into all the accounts that have the auto_connect flag set.

The account ID can be a number/tag (see account list), the protocol name or (part of) the screenname, as long as it matches only one connection.
%
?account off
Syntax: account [<account id>] off

This command disconnects the connection for the specified account. If no account is specified, BitlBee will deactivate all active accounts and cancel all pending reconnects.

The account ID can be a number/tag (see account list), the protocol name or (part of) the screenname, as long as it matches only one connection.
%
?account list
Syntax: account list

This command gives you a list of all the accounts known by BitlBee.
%
?account set
Syntax: account <account id> set
Syntax: account <account id> set <setting>
Syntax: account <account id> set <setting> <value>
Syntax: account <account id> set -del <setting>

This command can be used to change various settings for IM accounts. For all protocols, this command can be used to change the handle or the password BitlBee uses to log in and if it should be logged in automatically. Some protocols have additional settings. You can see the settings available for a connection by typing account <account id> set.

For more infomation about a setting, see help set <setting>.

The account ID can be a number/tag (see account list), the protocol name or (part of) the screenname, as long as it matches only one connection.
%
?channel
Syntax: channel [<account id>] <action> [<arguments>]

Available actions: del, list, set. See help channel <action> for more information.

There is no channel add command. To create a new channel, just use the IRC /join command. See also help channels and help groupchats.
%
?channel del
Syntax: channel <channel id> del

Remove a channel and forget all its settings. You can only remove channels you're not currently in, and can't remove the main control channel. (You can, however, leave it.)
%
?channel list
Syntax: channel list

This command gives you a list of all the channels you configured.
%
?channel set
Syntax: channel [<channel id>] set
Syntax: channel [<channel id>] set <setting>
Syntax: channel [<channel id>] set <setting> <value>
Syntax: channel [<channel id>] set -del <setting>

This command can be used to change various settings for channels. Different channel types support different settings. You can see the settings available for a channel by typing channel <channel id> set.

For more infomation about a setting, see help set <setting>.

The channel ID can be a number (see channel list), or (part of) its name, as long as it matches only one channel. If you want to change settings of the current channel, you can omit the channel ID.
%
?chat
Syntax: chat <action> [<arguments>]

Available actions: add, with. See help chat <action> for more information.
%
?chat add
Syntax: chat add <account id> <room> [<channel>]

Add a chatroom to the list of chatrooms you're interested in. BitlBee needs this list to map room names to a proper IRC channel name.

After adding a room to your list, you can simply use the IRC /join command to enter the room. Also, you can tell BitlBee to automatically join the room when you log in. (See chat set)

Password-protected rooms work exactly like on IRC, by passing the password as an extra argument to /join.
%
?chat with
Syntax: chat with <nickname>

While most chat subcommands are about named chatrooms, this command can be used to open an unnamed groupchat with one or more persons. This command is what /join #nickname used to do in older BitlBee versions.
%
?add
Syntax: add <account id> <handle> [<nick>]
Syntax: add -tmp <account id> <handle> [<nick>]

Adds the given buddy at the specified connection to your buddy list. The account ID can be a number (see account list), the protocol name or (part of) the screenname, as long as it matches only one connection.

If you want, you can also tell BitlBee what nick to give the new contact. The -tmp option adds the buddy to the internal BitlBee structures only, not to the real contact list (like done by set handle_unknown add). This allows you to talk to people who are not in your contact list. This normally won't show you any presence notifications.

If you use this command in a control channel containing people from only one group, the new contact will be added to that group automatically.

Example:
<ctrlsoft> add 3 gryp@jabber.org grijp
* grijp has joined &bitlbee
%
?info
Syntax: info <connection> <handle>
Syntax: info <nick>

Requests IM-network-specific information about the specified user. The amount of information you'll get differs per protocol. For some protocols (ATM Yahoo! and MSN) it'll give you an URL which you can visit with a normal web browser to get the information.

Example:
<ctrlsoft> info 0 72696705
<root> User info - UIN: 72696705   Nick: Lintux   First/Last name: Wilmer van der Gaast   E-mail: lintux@lintux.cx
%
?remove
Syntax: remove <nick>

Removes the specified nick from your buddy list.

Example:
<ctrlsoft> remove gryp
* gryp has quit [Leaving...]
%
?block
Syntax: block <nick>
Syntax: block <connection> <handle>
Syntax: block <connection>

Puts the specified user on your ignore list. Either specify the user's nick when you have him/her in your contact list or a connection number and a user handle.

When called with only a connection specification as an argument, the command displays the current block list for that connection.
%
?allow
Syntax: allow <nick>
Syntax: allow <connection> <handle>

Reverse of block. Unignores the specified user or user handle on specified connection.

When called with only a connection specification as an argument, the command displays the current allow list for that connection.
%
?otr
Syntax: otr <subcommand> [<arguments>]

Available subcommands: connect, disconnect, smp, smpq, trust, info, keygen, and forget. See help otr <subcommand> for more information.
%
?otr connect
Syntax: otr connect <nick>

Attempts to establish an encrypted connection with the specified user by sending a magic string.
%
?otr disconnect
Syntax: otr disconnect <nick>

Resets the connection with the specified user to cleartext.
%
?otr smp
Syntax: otr smp <nick> <secret>

Attempts to authenticate the given user's active fingerprint via the Socialist Millionaires' Protocol.

If an SMP challenge has been received from the given user, responds with the specified secret/answer. Otherwise, sends a challenge for the given secret.

Note that there are two flavors of SMP challenges: "shared-secret" and "question & answer". This command is used to respond to both of them, or to initiate a shared-secret style exchange. Use the otr smpq command to initiate a "Q&A" session.

When responding to a "Q&A" challenge, the local trust value is not altered. Only the asking party sets trust in the case of success. Use otr smpq to pose your challenge. In a shared-secret exchange, both parties set their trust according to the outcome.
%
?otr smpq
Syntax: otr smpq <nick> <question> <answer>

Attempts to authenticate the given user's active fingerprint via the Socialist Millionaires' Protocol, Q&A style.

Initiates an SMP session in "question & answer" style. The question is transmitted with the initial SMP packet and used to prompt the other party. You must be confident that only they know the answer. If the protocol succeeds (i.e. they answer correctly), the fingerprint will be trusted. Note that the answer must be entered exactly, case and punctuation count!

Note that this style of SMP only affects the trust setting on your side. Expect your opponent to send you their own challenge. Alternatively, if you and the other party have a shared secret, use the otr smp command.
%
?otr trust
Syntax: otr trust <nick> <fp1> <fp2> <fp3> <fp4> <fp5>

Manually affirms trust in the specified fingerprint, given as five blocks of precisely eight (hexadecimal) digits each.
%
?otr info
Syntax: otr info
Syntax: otr info <nick>

Shows information about the OTR state. The first form lists our private keys and current OTR contexts. The second form displays information about the connection with a given user, including the list of their known fingerprints.
%
?otr keygen
Syntax: otr keygen <account-no>

Generates a new OTR private key for the given account.
%
?otr forget
Syntax: otr forget <thing> <arguments>

Forgets some part of our OTR userstate. Available things: fingerprint, context, and key. See help otr forget <thing> for more information.
%
?otr forget fingerprint
Syntax: otr forget fingerprint <nick> <fingerprint>

Drops the specified fingerprint from the given user's OTR connection context. It is allowed to specify only a (unique) prefix of the desired fingerprint.
%
?otr forget context
Syntax: otr forget context <nick>

Forgets the entire OTR context associated with the given user. This includes current message and protocol states, as well as any fingerprints for that user.
%
?otr forget key
Syntax: otr forget key <fingerprint>

Forgets an OTR private key matching the specified fingerprint. It is allowed to specify only a (unique) prefix of the fingerprint.
%
?set
Syntax: set
Syntax: set <variable>
Syntax: set <variable> <value>
Syntax: set -del <variable>

Without any arguments, this command lists all the set variables. You can also specify a single argument, a variable name, to get that variable's value. To change this value, specify the new value as the second argument. With -del you can reset a setting to its default value.

To get more help information about a setting, try:

Example:
<ctrlsoft> help set private
%
?help
Syntax: help [subject]

This command gives you the help information you're reading right now. If you don't give any arguments, it'll give a short help index.
%
?save
Syntax: save

This command saves all your nicks and accounts immediately. Handy if you have the autosave functionality disabled, or if you don't trust the program's stability... ;-)
%
?rename
Syntax: rename <oldnick> <newnick>
Syntax: rename -del <oldnick>

Renick a user in your buddy list. Very useful, in fact just very important, if you got a lot of people with stupid account names (or hard ICQ numbers).

rename -del can be used to erase your manually set nickname for a contact and reset it to what was automatically generated.

Example:
<itsme> rename itsme_ you
* itsme_ is now known as you
%
?yes
Syntax: yes [<number>]

Sometimes an IM-module might want to ask you a question. (Accept this user as your buddy or not?) To accept a question, use the yes command.

By default, this answers the first unanswered question. You can also specify a different question as an argument. You can use the qlist command for a list of questions.
%
?no
Syntax: no [<number>]

Sometimes an IM-module might want to ask you a question. (Accept this user as your buddy or not?) To reject a question, use the no command.

By default, this answers the first unanswered question. You can also specify a different question as an argument. You can use the qlist command for a list of questions.
%
?qlist
Syntax: qlist

This gives you a list of all the unanswered questions from root.
%
?register
Syntax: register [<password>]

BitlBee can save your settings so you won't have to enter all your IM passwords every time you log in. If you want the Bee to save your settings, use the register command.

Please do pick a secure password, don't just use your nick as your password. Please note that IRC is not an encrypted protocol, so the passwords still go over the network in plaintext. Evil people with evil sniffers will read it all. (So don't use your root password.. ;-)

To identify yourself in later sessions, you can use the identify command. To change your password later, you can use the set password command.

You can omit the password and enter it separately using the IRC /OPER command. This lets you enter your password without your IRC client echoing it on screen or recording it in logs.
%
?identify
Syntax: identify [-noload|-force] [<password>]

BitlBee saves all your settings (contacts, accounts, passwords) on-server. To prevent other users from just logging in as you and getting this information, you'll have to identify yourself with your password. You can register this password using the register command.

Once you're registered, you can change your password using set password <password>.

The -noload and -force flags can be used to identify when you're logged into some IM accounts already. -force will let you identify yourself and load all saved accounts (and keep the accounts you're logged into already).

-noload will log you in but not load any accounts and settings saved under your current nickname. These will be overwritten once you save your settings (i.e. when you disconnect).

You can omit the password and enter it separately using the IRC /OPER command. This lets you enter your password without your IRC client echoing it on screen or recording it in logs.
%
?drop
Syntax: drop <password>

Drop your BitlBee registration. Your account files will be removed and your password will be forgotten. For obvious security reasons, you have to specify your NickServ password to make this command work.
%
?blist
Syntax: blist [all|online|offline|away]

You can get a more readable buddy list using the blist command. If you want a complete list (including the offline users) you can use the all argument.
%
?group
Syntax: group list

Only the group list command is supported at the moment, which shows a list of all groups defined so far.

If you want to move contacts between groups, you can use the IRC /invite command. Also, if you use the add command in a control channel configured to show just one group, the new contact will automatically be added to that group.
%
?transfer
Syntax: transfer [<cancel> id | <reject>]

Without parameters the currently pending file transfers and their status will be listed. Available actions are cancel and reject. See help transfer <action> for more information.

<ulim> transfer
%
?transfer cancel
Syntax: transfer <cancel> id

Cancels the file transfer with the given id

Example:
<ulim> transfer cancel 1
<root> Canceling file transfer for test
%
?transfer reject
Syntax: transfer <reject>

Rejects all incoming (not already transferring) file transfers. Since you probably have only one incoming transfer at a time, no id is neccessary. Or is it?

Example:
<ulim> transfer reject
%
?set account
Type: string
Scope: channel

For control channels with fill_by set to account: Set this setting to the account id (numeric, or part of the username) of the account containing the contacts you want to see in this channel.
%
?set allow_takeover
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: true

When you're already connected to a BitlBee server and you connect (and identify) again, BitlBee will offer to migrate your existing session to the new connection. If for whatever reason you don't want this, you can disable this setting.
%
?set auto_connect
Type: boolean
Scope: both
Default: true

With this option enabled, when you identify BitlBee will automatically connect to your accounts, with this disabled it will not do this.

This setting can also be changed for specific accounts using the account set command. (However, these values will be ignored if the global auto_connect setting is disabled!)
%
?set auto_join
Type: boolean
Scope: channel
Default: false

With this option enabled, BitlBee will automatically join this channel when you log in.
%
?set auto_reconnect
Type: boolean
Scope: both
Default: true

If an IM-connections breaks, you're supposed to bring it back up yourself. Having BitlBee do this automatically might not always be a good idea, for several reasons. If you want the connections to be restored automatically, you can enable this setting.

See also the auto_reconnect_delay setting.

This setting can also be changed for specific accounts using the account set command. (However, these values will be ignored if the global auto_reconnect setting is disabled!)
%
?set auto_reconnect_delay
Type: string
Scope: global
Default: 5*3<900

Tell BitlBee after how many seconds it should attempt to bring a broken IM-connection back up.

This can be one integer, for a constant delay. One can also set it to something like "10*10", which means wait for ten seconds on the first reconnect, multiply it by ten on every failure. Once successfully connected, this delay is re-set to the initial value. With < you can give a maximum delay.

See also the auto_reconnect setting.
%
?set auto_reply_timeout
Type: integer
Scope: account
Default: 10800

For Twitter accounts: If you respond to Tweets IRC-style (like "nickname: reply"), this will automatically be converted to the usual Twitter format ("@screenname reply").

By default, BitlBee will then also add a reference to that person's most recent Tweet, unless that message is older than the value of this setting in seconds.

If you want to disable this feature, just set this to 0. Alternatively, if you want to write a message once that is not a reply, use the Twitter reply syntax (@screenname).
%
?set away
Type: string
Scope: both

To mark yourself as away, it is recommended to just use /away, like on normal IRC networks. If you want to mark yourself as away on only one IM network, you can use this per-account setting.

You can set it to any value and BitlBee will try to map it to the most appropriate away state for every open IM connection, or set it as a free-form away message where possible.

Any per-account away setting will override globally set away states. To un-set the setting, use set -del away.
%
?set away_devoice
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: true

With this option enabled, the root user devoices people when they go away (just away, not offline) and gives the voice back when they come back. You might dislike the voice-floods you'll get if your contact list is huge, so this option can be disabled.

Replaced with the show_users setting. See help show_users.
%
?set away_reply_timeout
Type: integer
Scope: global
Default: 3600

Most IRC servers send a user's away message every time s/he gets a private message, to inform the sender that they may not get a response immediately. With this setting set to 0, BitlBee will also behave like this.

Since not all IRC clients do an excellent job at suppressing these messages, this setting lets BitlBee do it instead. BitlBee will wait this many seconds (or until the away state/message changes) before re-informing you that the person's away.
%
?set base_url
Type: string
Scope: account
Default: http://twitter.com

There are more services that understand the Twitter API than just Twitter.com. BitlBee can connect to all Twitter API implementations.

For example, set this setting to http://identi.ca/api to use Identi.ca.

Keep two things in mind: When not using Twitter, you must also disable the oauth setting as it currently only works with Twitter. If you're still having issues, make sure there is no slash at the end of the URL you enter here.
%
?set charset
Type: string
Scope: global
Default: utf-8
Possible Values: you can get a list of all possible values by doing 'iconv -l' in a shell

This setting tells BitlBee what your IRC client sends and expects. It should be equal to the charset setting of your IRC client if you want to be able to send and receive non-ASCII text properly.

Most systems use UTF-8 these days. On older systems, an iso8859 charset may work better. For example, iso8859-1 is the best choice for most Western countries. You can try to find what works best for you on http://www.unicodecharacter.com/charsets/iso8859.html
%
?set color_encrypted
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: true

If set to true, BitlBee will color incoming encrypted messages according to their fingerprint trust level: untrusted=red, trusted=green.
%
?set control_channel
Type: string
Scope: global
Default: &bitlbee

Normally the control channel where you can see all your contacts is called "&bitlbee". If you don't like this name, you can rename it to anything else using the rename command, or by changing this setting.
%
?set chat_type
Type: string
Scope: channel
Default: groupchat
Possible Values: groupchat, room

There are two kinds of chat channels: simple groupchats (basically normal IM chats with more than two participants) and names chatrooms, more similar to IRC channels.

BitlBee supports both types. With this setting set to groupchat (the default), you can just invite people into the room and start talking.

For setting up named chatrooms, it's currently easier to just use the chat add command.
%
?set commands
Type: boolean
Scope: account
Default: true

With this setting enabled, you can use some commands in your Twitter channel/query. The commands are simple and not documented in too much detail:

 undo [<id>] - Delete your last Tweet (or one with the given ID)
 rt <screenname|id> - Retweet someone's last Tweet (or one with the given ID)
 follow <screenname> - Start following a person
 unfollow <screenname> - Stop following a person
 post <message> - Post a tweet

Anything that doesn't look like a command will be treated as a tweet. Watch out for typos! :-)
%
?set debug
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: false

Some debugging messages can be sent to the control channel if you wish. They're probably not really useful for you, unless you're doing some development on BitlBee.
%
?set default_target
Type: string
Scope: global
Default: root
Possible Values: root, last

With this value set to root, lines written in the control channel without any nickname in front of them will be interpreted as commands. If you want BitlBee to send those lines to the last person you addressed in the control channel, set this to last.
%
?set display_name
Type: string
Scope: account

Currently only available for MSN connections. This setting allows you to read and change your "friendly name" for this connection. Since this is a server-side setting, it can't be changed when the account is off-line.
%
?set display_namechanges
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: false

With this option enabled, root will inform you when someone in your buddy list changes his/her "friendly name".
%
?set display_timestamps
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: true

When incoming messages are old (i.e. offline messages and channel backlogs), BitlBee will prepend them with a timestamp. If you find them ugly or useless, you can use this setting to hide them.
%
?set fill_by
Type: string
Scope: channel
Default: all
Possible Values: all, group, account, protocol

For control channels only: This setting determines which contacts the channel gets populated with.

By default, control channels will contain all your contacts. You instead select contacts by buddy group, IM account or IM protocol.

Change this setting and the corresponding account/group/protocol setting to set up this selection.

Note that, when creating a new channel, BitlBee will try to preconfigure the channel for you, based on the channel name. See help channels.
%
?set group
Type: string
Scope: channel

For control channels with fill_by set to group: Set this setting to the name of the group containing the contacts you want to see in this channel.
%
?set handle_unknown
Type: string
Scope: global
Default: add_channel
Possible Values: root, add, add_private, add_channel, ignore

Messages from unknown users are echoed like this by default:

<root> Unknown message from handle 3137137:
<root> j0000! 1 4m l33t h4x0r! kill me!

If you want this lame user to be added automatically, you can set this setting to "add". If you prefer to ignore messages from people you don't know, you can set this one to "ignore". "add_private" and "add_channel" are like add, but you can use them to make messages from unknown buddies appear in the channel instead of a query window.

Auto-added users aren't added to your real contact list. This is because you don't want the user to get authorization requests. So when you restart BitlBee, the auto-added user will be gone. If you want to keep the person in your buddy-list, you have to fixate the add using the add command.
%
?set ignore_auth_requests
Type: boolean
Scope: account
Default: false

Only supported by OSCAR so far, you can use this setting to ignore ICQ authorization requests, which are hardly used for legitimate (i.e. non-spam) reasons anymore.
%
?set lcnicks
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: true

Hereby you can change whether you want all lower case nick names or leave the case as it intended by your peer.
%
?set local_display_name
Type: boolean
Scope: account
Default: false

Mostly meant to work around a bug in MSN servers (forgetting the display name set by the user), this setting tells BitlBee to store your display name locally and set this name on the MSN servers when connecting.
%
?set mail_notifications
Type: boolean
Scope: account
Default: false

Some protocols (MSN, Yahoo!) can notify via IM about new e-mail. Since most people use their Hotmail/Yahoo! addresses as a spam-box, this is disabled default. If you want these notifications, you can enable this setting.
%
?set message_length
Type: integer
Scope: account
Default: 140

Since Twitter rejects messages longer than 140 characters, BitlBee can count message length and emit a warning instead of waiting for Twitter to reject it.

You can change this limit here but this won't disable length checks on Twitter's side. You can also set it to 0 to disable the check in case you believe BitlBee doesn't count the characters correctly.
%
?set mode
Type: string
Scope: account
Default: chat
Possible Values: one, many, chat

By default, BitlBee will create a separate channel (called #twitter_yourusername) for all your Twitter contacts/messages.

If you don't want an extra channel, you can set this setting to "one" (everything will come from one nick, twitter_yourusername), or to "many" (individual nicks for everyone).

With modes "chat" and "many", you can send direct messages by /msg'ing your contacts directly. Note, however, that incoming DMs are not fetched yet.

With modes "many" and "one", you can post tweets by /msg'ing the twitter_yourusername contact. In mode "chat", messages posted in the Twitter channel will also be posted as tweets.
%
?set mobile_is_away
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: false

Most IM networks have a mobile version of their client. People who use these may not be paying that much attention to messages coming in. By enabling this setting, people using mobile clients will always be shown as away.
%
?set nick
Type: string
Scope: chat

You can use this option to set your nickname in a chatroom. You won't see this nickname yourself, but other people in the room will. By default, BitlBee will use your username as the chatroom nickname.
%
?set nick_format
Type: string
Scope: both
Default: %-@nick

By default, BitlBee tries to derive sensible nicknames for all your contacts from their IM handles. In some cases, IM modules (ICQ for example) will provide a nickname suggestion, which will then be used instead. This setting lets you change this behaviour.

Whenever this setting is set for an account, it will be used for all its contacts. If it's not set, the global value will be used.

It's easier to describe this setting using a few examples:

FB-%full_name will make all nicknames start with "FB-", followed by the person's full name. For example you can set this format for your Facebook account so all Facebook contacts are clearly marked.

[%group]%-@nick will make all nicknames start with the group the contact is in between square brackets, followed by the nickname suggestions from the IM module if available, or otherwise the handle. Because of the "-@" part, everything from the first @ will be stripped.

See help nick_format for more information.
%
?set nick_source
Type: string
Scope: account
Default: handle
Possible Values: handle, full_name, first_name

By default, BitlBee generates a nickname for every contact by taking its handle and chopping off everything after the @. In some cases, this gives very inconvenient nicknames. The Facebook XMPP server is a good example, as all Facebook XMPP handles are numeric.

With this setting set to full_name, the person's full name is used to generate a nickname. Or if you don't like long nicknames, set this setting to first_name instead and only the first word will be used. Note that the full name can be full of non-ASCII characters which will be stripped off.
%
?set oauth
Type: boolean
Scope: account
Default: true

This enables OAuth authentication for Twitter accounts. From June 2010 this will be mandatory.

With OAuth enabled, you shouldn't tell BitlBee your Twitter password. Just add your account with a bogus password and type account on. BitlBee will then give you a URL to authenticate with Twitter. If this succeeds, Twitter will return a PIN code which you can give back to BitlBee to finish the process.

The resulting access token will be saved permanently, so you have to do this only once.
%
?set ops
Type: string
Scope: global
Default: both
Possible Values: both, root, user, none

Some people prefer themself and root to have operator status in &bitlbee, other people don't. You can change these states using this setting.

The value "both" means both user and root get ops. "root" means, well, just root. "user" means just the user. "none" means nobody will get operator status.
%
?set otr_policy
Type: string
Scope: global
Default: opportunistic
Possible Values: never, opportunistic, manual, always

This setting controls the policy for establishing Off-the-Record connections.

A value of "never" effectively disables the OTR subsystem. In "opportunistic" mode, a magic whitespace pattern will be appended to the first message sent to any user. If the peer is also running opportunistic OTR, an encrypted connection will be set up automatically. On "manual", on the other hand, OTR connections must be established explicitly using otr connect. Finally, the setting "always" enforces encrypted communication by causing BitlBee to refuse to send any cleartext messages at all.
%
?set password
Type: string
Scope: both

Use this global setting to change your "NickServ" password.

This setting is also available for all IM accounts to change the password BitlBee uses to connect to the service.

Note that BitlBee will always say this setting is empty. This doesn't mean there is no password, it just means that, for security reasons, BitlBee stores passwords somewhere else so they can't just be retrieved in plain text.
%
?set paste_buffer
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: false

By default, when you send a message to someone, BitlBee forwards this message to the user immediately. When you paste a large number of lines, the lines will be sent in separate messages, which might not be very nice to read. If you enable this setting, BitlBee will buffer your messages and wait for more data.

Using the paste_buffer_delay setting you can specify the number of seconds BitlBee should wait for more data before the complete message is sent.

Please note that if you remove a buddy from your list (or if the connection to that user drops) and there's still data in the buffer, this data will be lost. BitlBee will not try to send the message to the user in those cases.
%
?set paste_buffer_delay
Type: integer
Scope: global
Default: 200

Tell BitlBee after how many (mili)seconds a buffered message should be sent. Values greater than 5 will be interpreted as miliseconds, 5 and lower as seconds.

See also the paste_buffer setting.
%
?set port
Type: integer
Scope: account

Currently only available for Jabber connections. Specifies the port number to connect to. Usually this should be set to 5222, or 5223 for SSL-connections.
%
?set priority
Type: integer
Scope: account
Default: 0

Can be set for Jabber connections. When connecting to one account from multiple places, this priority value will help the server to determine where to deliver incoming messages (that aren't addressed to a specific resource already).

According to RFC 3921 servers will always deliver messages to the server with the highest priority value. Mmessages will not be delivered to resources with a negative priority setting (and should be saved as an off-line message if all available resources have a negative priority value).
%
?set private
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: true

If value is true, messages from users will appear in separate query windows. If false, messages from users will appear in the control channel.

This setting is remembered (during one session) per-user, this setting only changes the default state. This option takes effect as soon as you reconnect.
%
?set protocol
Type: string
Scope: channel

For control channels with fill_by set to protocol: Set this setting to the name of the IM protocol of all contacts you want to see in this channel.
%
?set query_order
Type: string
Scope: global
Default: lifo
Possible Values: lifo, fifo

This changes the order in which the questions from root (usually authorization requests from buddies) should be answered. When set to lifo, BitlBee immediately displays all new questions and they should be answered in reverse order. When this is set to fifo, BitlBee displays the first question which comes in and caches all the others until you answer the first one.

Although the fifo setting might sound more logical (and used to be the default behaviour in older BitlBee versions), it turned out not to be very convenient for many users when they missed the first question (and never received the next ones).
%
?set resource
Type: string
Scope: account
Default: BitlBee

Can be set for Jabber connections. You can use this to connect to your Jabber account from multiple clients at once, with every client using a different resource string.
%
?set resource_select
Type: string
Scope: account
Default: activity
Possible Values: priority, activity

Because the IRC interface makes it pretty hard to specify the resource to talk to (when a buddy is online through different resources), this setting was added.

Normally it's set to priority which means messages will always be delivered to the buddy's resource with the highest priority. If the setting is set to activity, messages will be delivered to the resource that was last used to send you a message (or the resource that most recently connected).
%
?set root_nick
Type: string
Scope: global
Default: root

Normally the "bot" that takes all your BitlBee commands is called "root". If you don't like this name, you can rename it to anything else using the rename command, or by changing this setting.
%
?set save_on_quit
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: true

If enabled causes BitlBee to save all current settings and account details when user disconnects. This is enabled by default, and these days there's not really a reason to have it disabled anymore.
%
?set server
Type: string
Scope: account

Can be set for Jabber- and OSCAR-connections. For Jabber, you might have to set this if the servername isn't equal to the part after the @ in the Jabber handle. For OSCAR this shouldn't be necessary anymore in recent BitlBee versions.
%
?set show_offline
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: false

If enabled causes BitlBee to also show offline users in Channel. Online-users will get op, away-users voice and offline users none of both. This option takes effect as soon as you reconnect.

Replaced with the show_users setting. See help show_users.
%
?set show_users
Type: string
Scope: channel
Default: online+,away

Comma-separated list of statuses of users you want in the channel, and any modes they should have. The following statuses are currently recognised: online (i.e. available, not away), away, and offline.

If a status is followed by a valid channel mode character (@, % or +), it will be given to users with that status. For example, online@,away+,offline will show all users in the channel. Online people will have +o, people who are online but away will have +v, and others will have no special modes.
%
?set simulate_netsplit
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: true

Some IRC clients parse quit messages sent by the IRC server to see if someone really left or just disappeared because of a netsplit. By default, BitlBee tries to simulate netsplit-like quit messages to keep the control channel window clean. If you don't like this (or if your IRC client doesn't support this) you can disable this setting.
%
?set ssl
Type: boolean
Scope: account
Default: false

Currently only available for Jabber connections. Set this to true if the server accepts SSL connections.
%
?set status
Type: string
Scope: both

Certain protocols (like Jabber/XMPP) support status messages, similar to away messages. They can be used to indicate things like your location or activity, without showing up as away/busy.

This setting can be used to set such a message. It will be available as a per-account setting for protocols that support it, and also as a global setting (which will then automatically be used for all protocols that support it).

Away states set using /away or the away setting will override this setting. To un-set the setting, use set -del status.
%
?set strip_html
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: true

Determines what BitlBee should do with HTML in messages. Normally this is turned on and HTML will be stripped from messages, if BitlBee thinks there is HTML.

If BitlBee fails to detect this sometimes (most likely in AIM messages over an ICQ connection), you can set this setting to always, but this might sometimes accidentally strip non-HTML things too.
%
?set switchboard_keepalives
Type: boolean
Scope: account
Default: false

Turn on this flag if you have difficulties talking to offline/invisible contacts.

With this setting enabled, BitlBee will send keepalives to MSN switchboards with offline/invisible contacts every twenty seconds. This should keep the server and client on the other side from shutting it down.

This is useful because BitlBee doesn't support MSN offline messages yet and the MSN servers won't let the user reopen switchboards to offline users. Once offline messaging is supported, this flag might be removed.
%
?set tag
Type: string
Scope: account

For every account you have, you can set a tag you can use to uniquely identify that account. This tag can be used instead of the account number (or protocol name, or part of the screenname) when using commands like account, add, etc. You can't have two accounts with one and the same account tag.

By default, it will be set to the name of the IM protocol. Once you add a second account on an IM network, a numeric suffix will be added, starting with 2.
%
?set timezone
Type: string
Scope: global
Default: local
Possible Values: local, utc, gmt, timezone-spec

If message timestamps are available for offline messages or chatroom backlogs, BitlBee will display them as part of the message. By default it will use the local timezone. If you're not in the same timezone as the BitlBee server, you can adjust the timestamps using this setting.

Values local/utc/gmt should be self-explanatory. timezone-spec is a time offset in hours:minutes, for example: -8 for Pacific Standard Time, +2 for Central European Summer Time, +5:30 for Indian Standard Time.
%
?set tls
Type: boolean
Scope: account
Default: try

Newer Jabber servers allow clients to convert a plain-text session to a TLS/SSL-encrypted session. Normally (with this setting set to try) BitlBee will do this, if possible.

If you want to force BitlBee to use TLS sessions only (and to give up if that doesn't seem to be possible) you can set this setting to true. Set it to false if you want the session to remain plain-text.
%
?set to_char
Type: string
Scope: global
Default: ": "

It's customary that messages meant for one specific person on an IRC channel are prepended by his/her alias followed by a colon ':'. BitlBee does this by default. If you prefer a different character, you can set it using set to_char.

Please note that this setting is only used for incoming messages. For outgoing messages you can use ':' (colon) or ',' to separate the destination nick from the message, and this is not configurable.
%
?set translate_to_nicks
Type: boolean
Scope: channel
Default: true

IRC's nickname namespace is quite limited compared to most IM protocols. Not any non-ASCII characters are allowed, in fact nicknames have to be mostly alpha-numeric. Also, BitlBee has to add underscores sometimes to avoid nickname collisions.

While normally the BitlBee user is the only one seeing these names, they may be exposed to other chatroom participants for example when addressing someone in the channel (with or without tab completion). By default BitlBee will translate these stripped nicknames back to the original nick. If you don't want this, disable this setting.
%
?set type
Type: string
Scope: channel
Default: control
Possible Values: control, chat

BitlBee supports two kinds of channels: control channels (usually with a name starting with a &) and chatroom channels (name usually starts with a #).

See help channels for a full description of channel types in BitlBee.
%
?set typing_notice
Type: boolean
Scope: global
Default: false

Sends you a /notice when a user starts typing a message (if supported by the IM protocol and the user's client). To use this, you most likely want to use a script in your IRC client to show this information in a more sensible way.
%
?set user_agent
Type: string
Scope: account
Default: BitlBee

Some Jabber servers are configured to only allow a few (or even just one) kinds of XMPP clients to connect to them.

You can change this setting to make BitlBee present itself as a different client, so that you can still connect to these servers.
%
?set web_aware
Type: string
Scope: account
Default: false

ICQ allows people to see if you're on-line via a CGI-script. (http://status.icq.com/online.gif?icq=UIN) This can be nice to put on your website, but it seems that spammers also use it to see if you're online without having to add you to their contact list. So to prevent ICQ spamming, recent versions of BitlBee disable this feature by default.

Unless you really intend to use this feature somewhere (on forums or maybe a website), it's probably better to keep this setting disabled.
%
?set xmlconsole
Type: boolean
Scope: account
Default: false

The Jabber module allows you to add a buddy xmlconsole to your contact list, which will then show you the raw XMPP stream between you and the server. You can also send XMPP packets to this buddy, which will then be sent to the server.

If you want to enable this XML console permanently (and at login time already), you can set this setting.
%

%
?groupchats
BitlBee now supports groupchats on all IM networks. This text will try to explain you how they work.

As soon as someone invites you into a groupchat, you will be force-joined or invited (depending on the protocol) into a new virtual channel with all the people in there. You can leave the channel at any time, just like you would close the window in regular IM clients. Please note that root-commands don't work in groupchat channels, they only work in the control channel (or to root directly).

Of course you can also create your own groupchats. Type help groupchats2 to see how.
%
?groupchats2
To open a groupchat, use the chat with command. For example, to start a groupchat with the person lisa_msn in it, just type chat with lisa_msn. BitlBee will create a new virtual channel with root, you and lisa_msn in it.

Then, just use the ordinary IRC /invite command to invite more people. Please do keep in mind that all the people have to be on the same network and contact list! You can't invite Yahoo! buddies into an MSN groupchat.

Some protocols (like Jabber) also support named groupchats. BitlBee now supports these too. You can use the chat add command to join them. See help chat add for more information.
%
?away
To mark yourself as away, you can just use the /away command in your IRC client. BitlBee supports most away-states supported by the protocols.

Away states have different names accross different protocols. BitlBee will try to pick the best available option for every connection:

 - Away
 - NA
 - Busy, DND
 - BRB
 - Phone
 - Lunch, Food
 - Invisible, Hidden

So /away Food will set your state to "Out to lunch" on your MSN connection, and for most other connections the default, "Away" will be chosen.

You can also add more information to your away message. Setting it to "Busy - Fixing BitlBee bugs" will set your IM-away-states to Busy, but your away message will be more descriptive for people on IRC. Most IM-protocols can also show this additional information to your buddies.

If you want to set an away state for only one of your connections, you can use the per-account away setting. See help set away.

?nick_changes
BitlBee now allows you to change your nickname. So far this was not possible because it made managing saved accounts more complicated.

The restriction no longer exists now though. When you change your nick (just using the /nick command), your logged-in status will be reset, which means any changes made to your settings/accounts will not be saved.

To restore your logged-in status, you need to either use the register command to create an account under the new nickname, or use identify -noload to re-identify yourself under the new nickname. The -noload flag tells the command to verify your password and log you in, but not load any new settings. See help identify for more information.
%
?channels
You can have as many channels in BitlBee as you want. You maintain your channel list using the channel command. You can create new channels by just joining them, like on regular IRC networks.

You can create two kinds of channels. Control channels, and groupchat channels. By default, BitlBee will set up new channels as control channels if their name starts with an &, and as chat channels if it starts with a #.

Control channels are where you see your contacts. By default, you will have one control channel called &bitlbee, containing all your contacts. But you can create more, if you want, and divide your contact list accross several channels.

For example, you can have one channel with all contacts from your MSN Messenger account in it. Or all contacts from the group called "Work".

Type help channels2 to read more.
%
?channels2
When you create a new channel, BitlBee will try to guess from its name which contacts to fill it with. For example, if the channel name (excluding the &) matches the name of a group in which you have one or more contacts, the channel will contain all those contacts.

Any valid account ID (so a number, protocol name or part of screenname, as long as it's unique) can also be used as a channel name. So if you just join &msn, it will contain all your MSN contacts. And if you have a Facebook account set up, you can see its contacts by just joining &facebook.

To start a simple group chat, you simply join a channel which a name starting with #, and invite people into it. All people you invite have to be on the same IM network and contact list.

If you want to configure your own channels, you can use the channel set command. See help channels3 for more information.
%
?channels3
The most important setting for a control channel is fill_by. It tells BitlBee what information should be used to decide if someone should be shown in the channel or not. After setting this setting to, for example, account, you also have to set the account setting. Example:

<wilmer> chan set &wlm fill_by account
<root> fill_by = `account'
<wilmer> chan set &wlm account msn
<root> account = `msn'

Also, each channel has a show_users setting which lets you choose, for example, if you want to see only online contacts in a channel, or also/just offline contacts. Example:

<wilmer> chan set &offline show_users offline
<root> show_users = `offline'

See the help information for all these settings for more information.
%
?nick_format
The nick_format setting can be set globally using the set command, or per account using account set (so that you can set a per-account suffix/prefix or have nicknames generated from full names for certain accounts).

The setting is basically some kind of format string. It can contain normal text that will be copied to the nick, combined with several variables:

 %nick - Nickname suggested for this contact by the IM protocol, or just the handle if no nickname was suggested.
 %handle - The handle/screenname of the contact.
 %full_name - The full name of the contact.
 %first_name - The first name of the contact (the full name up to the first space).
 %group - The name of the group this contact is a member of
 %account - Account tag of the contact

Invalid characters (like spaces) will always be stripped. Depending on your locale settings, characters with accents will be converted to ASCII.

See help nick_format2 for some more information.
%
?nick_format2
Two modifiers are currently available: You can include only the first few characters of a variable by putting a number right after the %. For example, [%3group]%-@nick will include only the first three characters of the group name in the nick.

Also, you can truncate variables from a certain character using the - modifier. For example, you may want to leave out everything after the @. %-@handle will expand to everything in the handle up to the first @.

?whatsnew010206
Twitter support. See help account add twitter.
%
?whatsnew010300
Support for multiple configurable control channels, each with a subset of your contact list. See help channels for more information.

File transfer support for some protocols (more if you use libpurple). Just /DCC SEND stuff. Incoming files also become DCC transfers.

Only if you run your own BitlBee instance: You can build a BitlBee that uses libpurple for connecting to IM networks instead of its own code, adding support for some of the more obscure IM protocols and features.

Many more things, briefly described in help news1.3.
%
?whatsnew030000
BitlBee can be compiled with support for OTR message encryption (not available on public servers since encryption should be end-to-end).

The MSN module was heavily updated to support features added to MSN Messenger over the recent years. You can now see/set status messages, send offline messages, and many strange issues caused by Microsoft breaking old-protocol compatibility should now be resolved.

Twitter extended: IRC-style replies ("BitlBee:") now get converted to proper Twitter replies ("@BitlBee") and get a reference to the original message (see help set auto_reply_timeout). Retweets and some other stuff is also supported now (see help set commands).
%
?news1.3
Most of the core of BitlBee was rewritten since the last release. This entry should sum up the majority of the changes.

First of all, you can now have as many control channels as you want. Or you can have none, it's finally possible to leave &bitlbee and still talk to all your contacts. Or you can have a &work with all your work-related contacts, or a &msn with all your MSN Messenger contacts. See help channels for more information about this.

Also, you can change how nicknames are generated for your contacts. Like automatically adding a [fb] tag to the nicks of all your Facebook contacts. See help nick_format.

When you're already connected to a BitlBee server and you connect from elsewhere, you can take over the old session.

Instead of account numbers, accounts now also get tags. These are automatically generated but can be changed (help set tag). You can now use them instead of accounts numbers. (Example: acc gtalk on)

Last of all: You can finally change your nickname and shorten root commands (try acc li instead of account list).
