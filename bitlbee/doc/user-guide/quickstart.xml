<title>Quickstart</title>

<para>
Welcome to BitlBee, your IRC gateway to ICQ, MSN, AOL, Jabber, Yahoo! and Twitter.
</para>

<para>
The center of BitlBee is the control channel, <emphasis>&amp;bitlbee</emphasis>. Two users will always be there, <emphasis>you</emphasis> (where "you" is the nickname you are using) and the system user, <emphasis>root</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
You need register so that all your IM settings (passwords, contacts, etc) can be saved on the BitlBee server. It's important that you pick a good password so no one else can access your account. Register with this password using the <emphasis>register</emphasis> command: <emphasis>register &lt;password&gt;</emphasis> (without the brackets!).
</para>

<para>
Be sure to remember your password. The next time you connect to the BitlBee server you will need to <emphasis>identify &lt;password&gt;</emphasis> so that you will be recognised and logged in to all the IM services automatically.
</para>

<para>
When finished, type <emphasis>help quickstart2</emphasis> to continue.

<para>
<emphasis>Step Two: Add and Connect To your IM Account(s).</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
To add an account to the account list you will need to use the <emphasis>account add</emphasis> command: <emphasis>account add &lt;protocol&gt; &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt; [&lt;server&gt;]</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
For instance, suppose you have a Jabber account at jabber.org with handle <emphasis>bitlbee@jabber.org</emphasis> with password <emphasis>QuickStart</emphasis>, you would:
</para>

<ircexample>
	<ircline nick="you">account add jabber bitlbee@jabber.org QuickStart</ircline>
	<ircline nick="root">Account successfully added</ircline>
</ircexample>

<para>
Other available IM protocols are msn, oscar, yahoo and twitter. OSCAR is the protocol used by ICQ and AOL. For more information about the <emphasis>account add</emphasis> command, see <emphasis>help account add</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
When you are finished adding your account(s) use the <emphasis>account on</emphasis> command to enable all your accounts, type <emphasis>help quickstart3</emphasis> to continue.
</para>

<title>Managing Contact Lists: Rename</title>

<!--quickstart3-->
<para>
<emphasis>Step Three: Managing Contact Lists: Rename</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
Now BitlBee logs in and downloads the contact list from the IM server. In a few seconds, all your on-line buddies should show up in the control channel.
</para>

<para>
BitlBee will convert names into IRC-friendly form (for instance: tux@example.com will be given the nickname tux). If you have more than one person who would have the same name by this logic (for instance: tux@example.com and tux@bitlbee.org) the second one to log on will be tux_. The same is true if you have a tux log on to AOL and a tux log on from Yahoo.
</para>

<para>
It would be easy to get these two mixed up, so BitlBee has a <emphasis>rename</emphasis> command to change the nickname into something more suitable: <emphasis>rename &lt;oldnick&gt; &lt;newnick&gt;</emphasis>
</para>

<ircexample>
	<ircline nick="you">rename tux_ bitlbeetux</ircline>
	<ircaction nick="tux_">is now known as <emphasis>bitlbeetux</emphasis></ircaction>
	<ircline nick="root">Nick successfully changed</ircline>
</ircexample>

When finished, type <emphasis>help quickstart4</emphasis> to continue.

<para>
<emphasis>Step Four: Managing Contact Lists: Add and Remove.</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
Now you might want to add some contacts, to do this we will use the <emphasis>add</emphasis> command. It needs two arguments: a connection ID (which can be a number (try <emphasis>account list</emphasis>), protocol name or (part of) the screenname) and the user's handle. It is used in the following way: <emphasis>add &lt;connection&gt; &lt;handle&gt;</emphasis>
</para>

<ircexample>
	<ircline nick="you">add 0 r2d2@example.com</ircline>
	<ircaction nick="r2d2"> has joined <emphasis>&amp;bitlbee</emphasis></ircaction>
</ircexample>

<para>
In this case r2d2 is online, since he/she joins the channel immediately. If the user is not online you will not see them join until they log on.
</para>

<para>
Lets say you accidentally added r2d3@example.com rather than r2d2@example.com, or maybe you just want to remove a user from your list because you never talk to them. To remove a name you will want to use the <emphasis>remove</emphasis> command: <emphasis>remove &lt;nick&gt;</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
When finished, type <emphasis>help quickstart5</emphasis> to continue.

<title>Chatting</title>

<para>
<emphasis>Step Five: Chatting.</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
First of all, a person must be on your contact list for you to chat with them (unless it's a group chat, <emphasis>help groupchats</emphasis> for more). If someone not on your contact list sends you a message, simply add them to the proper account with the <emphasis>add</emphasis> command. Once they are on your list and online, you can chat with them in &amp;bitlbee:
</para>

<ircexample>
	<ircline nick="you">tux: hey, how's the weather down there?</ircline>
	<ircline nick="tux">you: a bit chilly!</ircline>
</ircexample>

<para>
Note that, although all contacts are in the &amp;bitlbee channel, only tux will actually receive this message. The &amp;bitlbee channel shouldn't be confused with a real IRC channel.
</para>

<para>
If you prefer chatting in a separate window, use the <emphasis>/msg</emphasis> or <emphasis>/query</emphasis> command, just like on real IRC. BitlBee will remember how you talk to someone and show his/her responses the same way. If you want to change the default behaviour (for people you haven't talked to yet), see <emphasis>help set private</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
You know the basics. If you want to get to know more about BitlBee, please type <emphasis>help quickstart6</emphasis>.

<para>
<emphasis>So you want more than just chatting? Or maybe you're just looking for a feature?</emphasis>

Among these user settings you will find options for common issues, such as changing the charset, HTML stripping and automatic connecting (simply type <emphasis>set</emphasis> to see current user settings).
