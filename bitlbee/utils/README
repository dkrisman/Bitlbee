This directory contains tiny additional programs which you might just like
or need to run BitlBee:


* bitlbeed.c

If you want to run BitlBee on a machine you don't have root access to, this
utility will help you. Compiling it is easy: 'gcc bitlbeed.c -o bitlbeed',
you don't need any special flags. Use 'bitlbeed -h' to get more help.

For example, 'bitlbeed -p6669 -n1 /home/wilmer/bin/bitlbee' will start
listening on TCP port 6669 (on any interface, you might not want that!)
and connect the specified BitlBee program to this socket as soon as
someone connects. The -n1 makes sure only one person can be connected
at once.

Of course this program can be used for other programs too, not just BitlBee.


* convert_purple.py

Converts libpurple configs into something BitlBee can use, so you don't
have to re-add all your accounts by hand.


* BitlBee-specific Irssi scripts for: tab completion, typing notifica-
tions, auto-away and more, by Tijmen Ruizendaal <tijmen.ruizendaal@gmail.com>.

There are too many scripts to include them all with BitlBee (and keep
them up-to-date), so you should get them from Tijmen's site:

Please do send your sources if you write anything useful for the Bee!
